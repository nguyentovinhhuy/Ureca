# Accelerator
Accelerator is a software component designed to improve the performance of a blockchain network, e.g. Hyperledger Fabric, in terms of transaction throughput. Accelerator enables the blockchain network to deal with a huge number of transaction requests from applications. 

This project, named Innovation Sandbox, provides tools and methods to download, test, and reproduce the improved performance results using Accelerator on Hyperledger Fabric. The intent is to enable blockchain developers to run it to see how much performance benefits they can expect in reproducible ways.

## Innovation Sandbox

### Caliper with Accelerator Adaptor 
Caliper is a blockchain performance benchmark framework which is one of the Hyperledger projects. This project, Innovation Sandbox, also uses Caliper to measure the improved performance by Accelerator. The project was generated by forking Caliper project, and a new adaptor module and smart contracts were added to utilize Accelerator.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
To use Hyperledger Caliper, you must install the following tools in advance.
- NodeJS 8.X
- node-gyp
- Docker
- Docker-compose

#### Installing
Install the node modules from `innovation-sandbox/caliper` folder via the npm executable command.
```bash
$ npm install
```
Install the modules for the fabric through the following command in that folder.
```bash
$ npm run fabric-v1.2-deps
```

#### Running the tests
The current version supports two benchmark scenarios, simple and smallbank which are provided by Caliper. 

Move to the benchmark scenario directory (e.g. `caliper/benchmark/simple`, `caliper/benchmark/smallbank` ) and run `main.js` with option.
For example, the following command executes the performance evaluation with Accelerator in 1 organization with 2 peers network.
```bash
$ node main.js -n ../../network/fabric-v1.2/1org2peeraccelerator/accelerator-go.json
```
The command automatically downloads a docker image of Accelerator, configure Fabric network, and run benchmark tests.

Fabric benchmark test without Accelerator can be run by executing following command.
```bash
$ node main.js -n ../../network/fabric-v1.2/1org2peer/fabric-go.json
```

To modify test configuration, please check the `Configuration File` section on the [Caliper website](https://hyperledger.github.io/caliper/docs/2_Architecture.html).

**The test result can be varied depending on your environment.**
